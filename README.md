# something penguinify said


Why I stopped maintaining this project and deleted the website
- Too many people were using it for me to handle and I almost accidently lost $200 on aws bills
- Lack of people who could help me work on it because:
  1. This project is massive and hard to work through
  2. New and unfamiliar frameworks
  3. No documentation cause I got lazy and didn't want to write it for such a complicated framework.
- I'm moving on with my life and software development has little future. I want to work on electrical and mechanical engineering and work with languages like C.
If you want to continue it:
- If you have a lot of typescript and javascript knowledge then you could continue it... Though why would you? Contact me on discord if you have questions: @penguinify
